## Boats

this is proof-of-concept for collision detection &mdash; with circles!

Basically, each boat is the intersection of two circles (the "hitcircles"). If both hitcircles of one boat touch both hitcircles of another boat, then the two boats are colliding.

## How to use

Open `boats.html` in any web browser. click on the blue canvas to place boats.

the first boat placed will be controllable by the user &mdash; it is orange. all other boats are brown.

control the orange boat with the arrow keys: up and down to move forward and backward, left and right to rotate.

if two boats overlap, then they turn red.
