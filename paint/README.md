## Painting app

Just for fun: a painting app. With two canvases: one for the actual image, the other to draw tools.

## Controls

`Enter` to download the image as a `.png`.

`Space` to hide/show the controls panel.

## Notes

* it's really ugly (sorry!) because I'm a Javascript guy, not a CSS or HTML guy.

* this little project is not intended to replace anything. I just thought it'd be interesting to make it. (why after midnight, I have no idea)
