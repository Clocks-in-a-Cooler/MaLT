# MaLT &mdash; Many Little Things

This repo is for little demos and small projects. I'm usually testing out a new
framework or struggling with a proof-of-concept. If it's a good project, it'll
graduate and get its own repo!

Some projects which used to have their own repo have been moved here. Because I don't need that many empty repos.

Not sure where to start? Just click on one of the folders above &mdash; you never know!
